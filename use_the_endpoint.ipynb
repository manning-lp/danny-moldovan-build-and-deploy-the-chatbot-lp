Some of the features and capabilities of LangChain include:\\n\\n1. **Indexes**: Language models are enhanced when combined with your own text data, and LangChain covers best practices for integrating them.\\n   \\n2. **Chains**: LangChain allows for sequences of calls, not just single language model calls. It provides a standard interface for chains, integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\\n   \\n3. **Agents**: Agents involve a language model making decisions about actions to take, executing those actions, observing the results, and repeating the process until completion. LangChain offers a standard interface for agents, a selection of agent types, and examples of end-to-end agents.\\n   \\n4. **Use Cases**: LangChain supports various common use cases such as personal assistants, question answering, chatbots, data augmented generation, summarization, querying tabular data, interacting with APIs, extraction, and evaluation of generative models.\\n\\n5. **Memory**: LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, which allows for persisting state between calls of a chain or agent. It includes various memory implementations and examples of chains or agents that utilize memory.\\n\\n6. **Chat Models**: LangChain supports chat models, which are a variation of language models that work with messages instead of raw text. It provides a standard interface for working with chat models and performing similar tasks as with language models.\\n\\nThese features and capabilities make LangChain a versatile tool for working with language models in various applications and scenarios.', 'source_documents': [{'page_content': \"{'id': '8106ff3953b7-21', 'text': 'that use memory.\\\\\\\\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\\\\\\\\nChains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility).
