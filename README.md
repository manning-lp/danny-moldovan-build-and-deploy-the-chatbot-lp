Repository for liveProject: Build and Deploy the Chatbot

**Dataset**

We will be using the vector database already created in the previous project, but if you’re starting from here, you can download the vector store (chrome_db.zip) from here. Remember you will still have to initialise the vector store object according to the documentation.

**Libraries and setup*+

The required libraries include the following:

Python
OpenAI
LangChain
ChromaDB
Streamlit
Langserve

**Disclaimer**

This liveProject employs OpenAI’s API, which is a paid service. While OpenAI may offer free credits to new account holders, subsequent usage is subject to charges.
